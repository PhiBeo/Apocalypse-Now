  eventDescription: "I woke up to the dull hum of the ventilation system again. I
    can\u2019t remember the last time I heard real wind, but I think I dreamed about
    it. I lay there for a while, just listening. Someone was already up, shuffling
    around the kitchen area. I dragged myself out of my bunk, careful not to wake
    other."
