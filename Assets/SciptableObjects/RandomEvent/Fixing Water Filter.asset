  m_Name: Fixing Water Filter
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  eventDescription: "I spent most of the day fixing one of the water filters. It
    was acting up again, spitting water in weak, inconsistent dribbles. It took me
    a while, but I got it working correctly. It\u2019s weird how satisfying small
    victories feel down here as if I did something worthwhile."
