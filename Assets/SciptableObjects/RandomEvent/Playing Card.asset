  eventDescription: We played a few rounds of card after dinner. It's nothing too
    serious, just a way to pass the time. The lights flickered once while we were
    playing, and everything got really quiet for a second. We all noticed, but nobody
    said anything. I just went back to the game like nothing happened. The generator's
    been holding up, but every little flicker makes my stomach knot up.
