  eventDescription: 'The flesh eating bacteria had now become a major issue. They
    turn humans into undead creatures, commonly known as zombies. The governments
    are trying to control the spread. We recommend staying inside your bunker and
    only going out only if there is an emergency situation. You will need to equip
    yourself with weapons and masks in order to survive outside.
