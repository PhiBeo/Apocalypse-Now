  eventDescription: "There were loud bangs on the bunker door, and they told us to
    give half of our resources to them. They threatened that if we didn\u2019t give
    them, they would attempt to break the door and steal everything from us. Should
    I open the door?"
  acceptText: Just to make sure no one gets hurt, we open the door and give them
    half of the resources that we have at the moment. This might seem too cowardly,
    but it ensures everyone is safe.
  diceChanceSucceedText: "They tried to open the door with everything they had, but
    it stood firm. After a while, the sound completely stops. It seems like luck
    is on our side, I don\u2019t know what will happen if they manage to get in the
    bunker. "
  diceChanceFailText: "They managed to open the door after a few tries, and they
    started beating us up. I don\u2019t know why, but they stop after a while. They
    are everything we have and left."
